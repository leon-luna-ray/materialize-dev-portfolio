# Vanilla.js Portfolio

This is my web developer portfolio buiilt with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It contains my bio, a list of skills, featured projects, and contact information.

Site content is pulled from Sanity.io CMS and rendered dynamically with JavaScript. This updates the content automatically and keeps it up to date across all of my portfolio sites.

This was an early portfolio project orginally a static website built with HTML and MaterializeCSS.
