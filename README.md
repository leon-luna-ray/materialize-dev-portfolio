# Materialize Portfolio

This is an early portfolio project built with HTML and Materialize CSS. It contains my bio, a list of skills, featured projects, and contact information. Originally developed as a static HTML website. I refactored it to pull content from Sanity.io CMS and render HTML dynamically with vanilla JavaScript. This updates the content automatically and keeps it up to date.
